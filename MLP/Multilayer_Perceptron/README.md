# DeepLearning
 

## Description
This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Code Overview
- `mnist.load_data()`: Loads the MNIST dataset.
- Display one image for each digit using Matplotlib.
- Reshape and normalize input data.
- Build a neural network model with two hidden layers.
- Compile the model using Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
- Train the model on the training data.
- Plot training history for accuracy and loss.
- Evaluate the model on the test set.
- Display predictions and actual digit images.

## Dependencies
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `tensorflow` for machine learning framework.
- `keras` for building and training neural networks.
- `matplotlib` for data visualization.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
4. Run the script: `python your_script.py`

## Results
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots.
- Test accuracy and loss values.
- Predictions on the test set with corresponding digit images.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the model or adapt it for different datasets. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!
