## Description
This repository contains a basic implementation of a perceptron, an artificial neuron model, using NumPy and Matplotlib. The perceptron is trained on synthetic data generated for two classes and visualizes the decision boundary.

## Code Overview
- Generate synthetic data for two classes and visualize it using Matplotlib.
- Initialize the parameters (weights and bias) of the perceptron.
- Implement the artificial neuron model, log loss, gradient calculation, and parameter update functions.
- Train the perceptron using an iterative algorithm, visualizing the loss during training.
- Test the trained perceptron on new data and display the classification results.
- Visualize the decision boundary learned by the perceptron.

## Dependencies
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` for data visualization.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
4. Run the script: `python your_script.py`

## Results
- Visual representation of synthetic data points for two classes.
- Loss plot during the training of the perceptron.
- Visualization of the decision boundary learned by the perceptron.
- Classification results on new data.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different datasets or tweak the perceptron parameters. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!
